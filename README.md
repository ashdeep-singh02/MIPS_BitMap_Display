Goal of this project was to write a non-trivial MIPS program, and execute it using a MIPS simulator (MARS).

End Result: MIPS Program which draws a 2D shape.

## Input
The input will be the assembly language version of the following C structure:
`
struct projInput{
  unsigned m, n;
  unsigned c1r, c1g, c1b;
   unsigned c2r, c2g, c2b;
}
`
