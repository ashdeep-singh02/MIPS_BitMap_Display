# MIPS_BitMap_Display
Goal of this project was to write a non-trivial MIPS program, and execute it using a MIPS simulator (MARS).

End Result: MIPS Program which draws a 2D shape.

## Input
The input will be the assembly language version of the following C structure:

```c
struct projInput {
  unsigned m, n; // size parameters
  unsigned c1r, c1g, c1b; // color 1 specs
  unsigned c2r, c2g, c2b; // color 2 specs
}
```

## Running MARS:
1) Select Tools -> Bitmap Display
2) Click Connect to MARS button
3) Assemble and run via MARS

## Output:
